### Mining and Processing Plant

Functions include extraction, enrichment, and sale of quartz sand for various industries. Processing includes crushing, magnetic separation, washing, drying, calcining, and other methods to enhance material properties. Quality control measures track iron, silicon, aluminum oxides, grain size distribution, clay content, and moisture in both raw and enriched quartz sands. These plants provide essential raw materials for metallurgical, manufacturing, and construction industries.

### Glass Production

Quartz sand is the main raw material for various types of glass, including window glass, tableware, porcelain, mirrors, and other glass products. The glass contains up to 65-73% of quartz sand of the so-called ‘glass grade’, which is abundant in our deposit.

### Steel Industry

 A moulding type of sand is being used. It contains at least 90% silicon dioxide and no more than 2% clay component, giving the material high refractoriness and moisture resistance. Our deposit contains raw materials that meet and exceed the quality requirements for this purpose.

### Brick Production

Quartz sand is used for silicate brick production. It is the main component, ensuring good adhesion and shape stability. Quartz sand fraction <nobr>0.1–5 mm</nobr> is used. Before use, it is pre-washed, dried, and cleaned of impurities.

### Microelectronics Production

Quartz sand is the base material for microelectronics, particularly processors. It contains silicon, a semiconductor, allowing the creation of microcircuits of any structure. The process involves: converting raw material into the purest form with the correct structure (1), creating a silicon single crystal (2), preparing wafers from the single crystal (3), «printing» the processor (4). Our deposit's quartz sand, consisting almost entirely of silicon oxide, is excellent raw material for microelectronic components.

### Road Construction

Sand is used at every stage of road construction – preparing the road base, backfilling intermediate layers, and constructing the top surface. The sand deposit is located in a promising road construction zone near major transport hubs (including proximity to a federal highway) and megacities (Volgograd and Volzhsky).

### Reinforced Concrete Products Production

Sand is used in reinforced concrete products (RCP) as a fine aggregate. It's main task is to fill voids between gravel grains to ensure uniform strength characteristics throughout the concrete mix volume.

### Paving Tile Production

Quartz sand is promising as raw material for manufacturing fired ceramic road construction products, including tiles. Additionally, sand is used for grouting tile joints.

### Construction Materials

Sand is one of the main construction materials. It is included in basic dry mixes, masonry and plaster mixes, and concretes.

### Landscaping

Sand is a universal material for landscaping. It can create cozy corners, zone spaces, add texture. Sand is used for leveling plots, backfilling roads, sidewalks, and platforms, arranging beaches, creating sandboxes.

### Abrasive Blasting

Quartz sand is used in sandblasting units for polishing, removing rust, and contaminants from various surfaces.

### Filtration Systems

Household water filters for water pipes and pools, and even industrial filtration stations use quartz sand.

      text: `
It is important to recognize that this quarry is not a typical asset when determining its value. Price ranges in this specialized market can vary considerably. Professional valuators typically require assistance from geologists and mining engineers due to the specialized nature of subsoil use valuation.

The state, when conducting a tender or auction for the right to use a subsoil plot, usually calculates the starting payment size according to the order of the Ministry of Natural Resources of Russia No. 232 dated September 30, 2008 «On approval of the Methodology for determining the starting size of a one-time payment for subsoil use». The starting payment size is not the market value of the deposit, but it is the first step to understanding the **minimum valuation of the object**.

The starting one-time payment provides an understanding of how the state values the subsoil resources based on the average annual volume of mineral extraction and the average annual amount of mineral extraction tax. Knowing the total volume of balance reserves and the average annual extraction volume, one can calculate the number of years for deposit development.

Based on these methodologies, specialists from a state geological institution calculated the starting payment for our quarry (if the object were auctioned for the right to use the subsoil for <nobr>49 years</nobr>). It's size amounted to <nobr>327 million ₽</nobr>. In order for the transaction to go through, the cost of one auction step must also be paid. According to the Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation No. 2499 dated December 28, 2021, the size of the auction step for the right to use a subsoil plot is 10% of the minimum (starting) size of the one-time payment. Thus, the **base cost** of leasing the quarry for <nobr>49 years</nobr> would be: <nobr>327 million ₽</nobr> (starting auction price) + <nobr>32.7 million ₽</nobr> (minimum size of one auction step) = <nobr>**359.7 million ₽**</nobr>.

In our case, the quarry is privately owned, which is its undeniable advantage. Furthermore, the quarry owner has the right to extract minerals for <nobr>177 years</nobr>.

      text: `
Market value is the most probable price at which an asset can be sold on the open market under competitive conditions, where the parties to the transaction act reasonably, possessing all necessary information, and the transaction price is not affected by any significant circumstances.

The development of our deposit implies deploying a multi-profile business in various market niches. The combined advantages of convenient location (1), exceptional mineral quality (2), huge volume of reserves (3), long-term license (4), favorable extraction conditions (5), availability of extensive land for constructing production complexes near the quarry (6), technical capability of supplying the enterprise with electricity, gas and water (7) - all that significantly distinguish the object from the majority of mining enterprises in Russia, which are narrowly focused primarily on selling sand for the construction industry.

When determining the market value, we suggest to be guided by the price of similar objects, information about the sale of which is published on various Internet resources. But the problem is that finding an object with analogous area, reserves volume, logistics, and other factors is difficult.

We have analysed ALL offers for the sale of sand quarries in the Russian Federation. However, we could not find a similar analogue to our quarry. Nevertheless, we have found some tendencies in field pricing, which we propose you to review in the next section.

We present a selection of sand quarries in Russia that are currently on public sale. These are mostly sites with standard «construction grade» sand, the use of which is limited to construction industries. There are very few quarries with quartz sand of «glass grade» on sale, so for completeness of information several sold objects are added to the list. Based on the obtained information, calculations of the average cost per m³ of sand in the subsoil are made.
      `.trim(),
      text2: `
The spread of prices for mineral deposits is very large. The cheapest m³ of «construction grade» sand was found in the Chelyabinsk region at the price of <nobr>7.28 ₽</nobr> per m³ of sand, and the most expensive - in the Mordovia Republic at a record price of <nobr>145 ₽ per m³</nobrr>.

The largest «glass grade» quartz sand deposit, which can be compared to our quarry, was sold in the Lipetsk region. The reserves of the deposit are more than <nobr>100 million tons</nobr>. The quarry was sold as part of a mining company, which had machinery and buildings on its balance sheet. The total value of this complex totaled <nobr>1.096 billion ₽</nobr>. The seller invested an amount of <nobr>450 million ₽</nobr> in the development of the enterprise (purchase of machinery, construction of a building, documentation for the deposit). Accordingly, the estimated cost of the quarry in the enterprise price structure amounted to <nobr>646 million ₽</nobr>.

**Conclusions based on the analysis of the sand deposit sales market**:
- The average subsoil price of «construction grade» sand is <nobr>40.3 ₽</nobr> per m³, «glass grade» sand is <nobr>42.3 ₽</nobr> per m³ (based on processing all public data on quarry sales in the present and past tense for the Russian Federation)
- Prices for «construction» and «glass» sands differ insignificantly, while the value of their commercial use is not comparable
- Quartz sand deposits are very rare (especially for «glass grades»), their demand is growing due to economic development of application areas
- The larger the reserves of the deposit, the cheaper the cost of extraction m³ of mineral resource

**The cost of mineral reserves in the subsoil of our quarry (excluding operating costs of extraction and processing)**:
- Extractable reserves in tonnes = <nobr>81,586,563 m³</nobr> (confirmed reserves) − 10% (losses during mineral extraction) = <nobr>73,427,906.7 m³</nobr> (amount of extractable reserves) / 0.62 = <nobr>**118,432,107 tonnes**</nobr> (extractable reserves in tonnes).
- Average cost of basic quality construction sand = <nobr>**380 ₽/tonne**</nobr>
- Average cost of quartz («glass») sand = <nobr>**2,500 ₽/tonne**</nobr>
- Fair price of quartz sand for participants of the «industrial park» project = <nobr>**1,000 ₽/tonne**</nobr>

Thus, the types of mining activities can significantly impact the final selling price of the sand. If the quarry is used narrowly for supplying construction industry counterparties, the reserves are valued at <nobr>**45 billion ₽**</nobr> (<nobr>118,432,107 t</nobr> × <nobr>380 ₽</nobr>). If an industrial park is to be developed on the territory of the deposit (or own production facilities are to be built), the value of reserves will be as follows: <nobr>**120 billion ₽**</nobr> (<nobr>118,432,107 tonnes</nobr> × 1000 ₽) <nobr>to **300 billion ₽**</nobr> (<nobr>118,432,107 tonnes</nobr> × ₽ 2500).

**Our Quarry Valuation**

Considering the market trend of decreasing deposit value relative to its reserve size (the larger the object, the cheaper the base cost per <nobr>1 m³</nobr> of minerals), we believe a fair valuation for this property is approximately <nobr>6.5 ₽</nobr> per <nobr>1 m³</nobr>, and the total quarry cost around <nobr>530 million ₽</nobr> (<nobr>81,586,563 m³</nobr> × <nobr>6.5 ₽</nobr>). Note that the cheapest cubic meter of extracted sand (not quartz, but 2nd class) on the Russian Federation market for «construction grade» is <nobr>7.28 ₽,</nobr> and for «glass grade» is <nobr>17.67 ₽</nobr> (refer to the table).

However, considering that our deposit is very large (and has no equivalent on the market), also we are interested in a quick sale of the property, and have formed a special price offer calculated based on the **state valuation of the object + 5%**.

**The final selling price** of the deposit is:  
<nobr>359.7 million ₽</nobr> + 5% = <nobr>**377.7 million ₽**</nobr>.

**Calculation of the average cost per <nobr>1 m³</nobr>**:  
<nobr>377,700,000 ₽</nobr> (total cost) ÷ <nobr>81,586,563 m³</nobr> (quantity of reserves) = <nobr>**4.63 ₽**</nobr>.

**Your advantage is obvious!**
