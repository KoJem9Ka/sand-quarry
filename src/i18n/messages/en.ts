### Mining and Processing Plant
Functions include extraction, enrichment, and sale of quartz sand for various industries. Technology involves crushing, magnetic separation, washing, drying, calcining, and other processing methods to improve material characteristics. Quality control of raw and enriched quartz sands monitors iron, silicon, aluminum oxides, granulometric composition, clay content, and moisture. Plants supply necessary raw materials to metallurgical, machine-building, and construction companies.
### Glass Production
Quartz sand is the main raw material for various types of glass, including window glass, tableware, porcelain, mirrors, and other glass products. Glass contains up to 65–73% of «glass grade» quartz sand, which is abundant in our deposit.
### Steel Industry
Molding sand type is used. It contains at least 90% silicon dioxide and no more than 2% clay component, giving the material high refractoriness and moisture resistance. Our deposit has raw material of the required quality (and even exceeds specifications) for this activity.
### Brick Production
Quartz sand is used for silicate brick production. It is the main component, ensuring good adhesion and shape stability. Quartz sand fraction <nobr>0.1–5 mm</nobr> is used. Before use, it is pre-washed, dried, and cleaned of impurities.
### Microelectronics Production
Quartz sand is the base material for microelectronics, particularly processors. It contains silicon, a semiconductor, allowing the creation of microcircuits of any structure. The process involves: converting raw material into the purest form with the correct structure (1), creating a silicon single crystal (2), preparing wafers from the single crystal (3), «printing» the processor (4). Our deposit's quartz sand, consisting almost entirely of silicon oxide, is excellent raw material for microelectronic components.
### Road Construction
Sand is used at every stage of road construction – preparing the road base, backfilling intermediate layers, and constructing the top surface. The sand deposit is located in a promising road construction zone near major transport hubs (including close proximity to a federal highway) and megacities (Volgograd and Volzhsky).
### Reinforced Concrete Products Production
Sand is used in reinforced concrete products (RCP) as a fine aggregate. Its main task is to fill voids between gravel grains to ensure uniform strength characteristics throughout the concrete mix volume.
### Paving Tile Production
Quartz sand is promising as raw material for manufacturing fired ceramic road construction products, including tiles. Additionally, sand is used for grouting tile joints.
### Construction Materials
Sand is one of the main construction materials. It is included in basic dry mixes, masonry and plaster mixes, and concretes.
### Landscaping
Sand is a universal material for landscaping. It can create cozy corners, zone spaces, add texture. Sand is used for leveling plots, backfilling roads, sidewalks, and platforms, arranging beaches, creating sandboxes.
### Abrasive Treatment
Quartz sand is used in sandblasting units for polishing, removing rust, and contaminants from various surfaces.
### Filtration Systems
Household water filters for water mains and pools, and even industrial filtration stations use quartz sand.

      text: `
It is proposed to implement the concept of creating an **industrial park** based on the quartz sand deposit, which will represent a complex of enterprises for processing the extracted minerals on a common land plot. The territory free from the deposit has an area of <nobr>187 Ha</nobr>. This is quite sufficient for implementing a project of this scale.

Activity Spheres of the Industrial Park Enterprises:
- **Mineral Enrichment** (preparation of raw materials for the needs of the park's enterprises and beyond)
- **Glass Industry** (production of sheet and container glass, glass wall blocks, float glass, etc.)
- **Construction Industry** (production of aerated concrete, bricks, dry construction mixes, building materials, ceramic products)
- **Electronics Industry** (production of components for microelectronics)
- **Metallurgical Industry** (production of molding material for steel, cast iron, and non-ferrous casting)

Constructing a mining and processing plant on own land using raw resources extracted from its own deposits allows minimizing the production cost.

The uniqueness of this project lies in creating a single cycle of enterprises from extraction to final product production on its own territory. This system eliminates all risks associated with raw material supply for production and ensures complete independence from third-party suppliers, as well as significantly reducing the final product cost. Land plots for project participants can be transferred into ownership or lease (depending on the specifics of the enterprises).

An industrial park as a site equipped with the necessary engineering and transport infrastructure and energy resources can attract not only companies from the Volgograd Oblast and Russia but also investors from the CIS, China, India, and many other countries as project participants.

When determining the quarry's value, it should be noted that this is not a typical asset. The range of price offers in this niche market can be very significant. Most professional appraisers lack specialized knowledge in subsoil use, so assistance from geologists and mining engineers is required.

The state, when conducting a tender or auction for the right to use a subsoil plot, usually calculates the starting payment size according to the order of the Ministry of Natural Resources of Russia No. 232 dated September 30, 2008 «On approval of the Methodology for determining the starting size of a one-time payment for subsoil use». The starting payment size is not the market value of the deposit, but it is the first step to understanding the **minimum valuation of the object**.

The starting one-time payment provides an understanding of how the state values the subsoil resources based on the average annual volume of mineral extraction and the average annual amount of mineral extraction tax. Knowing the total volume of balance reserves and the average annual extraction volume, one can calculate the number of years for deposit development.

Based on these methodologies, specialists from a state geological institution calculated the starting payment for our quarry (if the object were auctioned for the right to use the subsoil for <nobr>49 years</nobr>). Its size amounted to <nobr>327 million ₽</nobr>. For the transaction to occur, the cost of one auction step must also be paid. According to the Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation No. 2499 dated December 28, 2021, the size of the auction step for the right to use a subsoil plot is 10% of the minimum (starting) size of the one-time payment. Thus, the base cost of leasing the quarry for <nobr>49 years</nobr> would be: <nobr>327 million ₽</nobr> (starting auction price) + <nobr>32.7 million ₽</nobr> (minimum size of one auction step) = <nobr>359.7 million ₽</nobr>.

In our case, the quarry is privately owned, which is its undeniable advantage. Furthermore, the quarry owner has the right to extract minerals for <nobr>177 years</nobr>. Thus, we conclude that the **lower threshold for the value of our deposit is <nobr>359.7 million ₽</nobr>**.

Market value is the most probable price at which an asset can be sold on the open market under competitive conditions, where the parties to the transaction act reasonably, possessing all necessary information, and the transaction price is not affected by any significant circumstances.

The development of our deposit implies deploying a multi-profile business in various market niches. The combination of characteristics such as convenient location (1), exceptional quality of minerals (2), huge volume of reserves (3), long-term license (4), favorable extraction conditions (5), availability of extensive land for constructing production complexes near the quarry (6), technical possibility of supplying the enterprise with electricity, gas, and water (7) – strongly distinguishes the object from small regional mining enterprises, narrowly focused primarily on selling sand for the construction industry.

When determining the market value, we suggest focusing on the price of similar objects, information about the sale of which is published on various internet resources. But the problem is that finding an object with analogous area, reserves volume, logistics, and other factors is difficult.

Nevertheless, we conducted an analysis of ALL offers for the sale of sand quarries in the Russian Federation. However, we could not find a worthy analogue to our quarry in terms of reserves volume (1), combined parameters of mineral quality (2), productivity level (potential annual extraction volumes + permitted extraction period) (3).

We invite you to review the sample from the analysis of current market offers for the sale of sand deposits in the next section.

We present a selection of sand quarries in the Russian Federation currently available for public sale. Special attention was paid to deposits located near large cities, possessing reserves of high-quality non-waterlogged sand suitable for open-pit mining. Attention was given to the presence of a license and the legal status of the lands of the offered natural objects. Based on the obtained data, calculations of the average cost per m³ of sand in the subsoil were made.
      `.trim(),
      text2: `
The price range for deposits is very large. The cheapest m³ of sand resources found was in the Vladimir Oblast – <nobr>8 ₽</nobr> per m³ of 2nd class sand. This is almost twice the base valuation of our quarry's quartz sand, which is significantly more valuable than the comparison object. The most expensive m³ from our comparative analysis costs a record <nobr>145 ₽</nobr> for 2nd class sand resources (quarry in the Republic of Mordovia).

There are very few quarries with quartz sand currently for sale. About a dozen quartz quarries sold over the past 3 years have been identified, confirming the demand for this type of natural resource. The largest publicly offered quartz sand deposit was found in the Voronezh Oblast - reserves of <nobr>7 million m³</nobr> (<nobr>11 million tonnes</nobr>), land plot is leased, license for exploration and extraction for <nobr>16 years</nobr>, object cost – <nobr>300 million ₽</nobr> (average price per m³ – 42.85).

As a result of the analysis, we could not identify subsoil objects for any objective comparison with our offer – neither by volume and quality of reserves, nor by deposit cost, nor by other accompanying conditions.

Conclusions based on the analysis of the sand deposit sales market:
- The average cost of sand resources in the RF is <nobr>39.21 ₽</nobr> per <nobr>1 m³</nobr> (based on processing data from all offers for sand quarries currently for sale).
- The larger the quarry reserves, the cheaper the average price per m³ (the law of the wholesale market applies).
- The price range for quartz sand in the subsoil varies from 18.63 to <nobr>42.85 ₽</nobr> per <nobr>1 m³</nobr>.
- There are no quartz sand quarries presented on the market that could be compared with our offer (by quantity of reserves and quality of sand, as well as the combination of other criteria).
- The cost of most offers is insufficiently justified and is spontaneous.

**Calculation of the value of mineral reserves in the quarry subsoil (excluding operating expenses)**:

Extractable reserves in tonnes = <nobr>81,586,563 m³</nobr> (confirmed reserves) − 10% (losses during mineral extraction) = <nobr>73,427,906.7 m³</nobr> (extractable reserves) / 0.62 = <nobr>118,432,107 tonnes</nobr> (extractable reserves in tonnes).

Average cost of basic quality construction sand = <nobr>380 ₽/tonne</nobr>

Average cost of quartz ('glass') sand = <nobr>2,500 ₽/tonne</nobr>

Fair price of quartz sand for participants of the 'industrial park' project = <nobr>1,000 ₽/tonne</nobr>

Thus, the activities of the mining enterprise can significantly affect the final selling price of the sand. If the quarry is used narrowly for supplying construction industry counterparties, the reserves are valued at <nobr>45 billion ₽</nobr> (<nobr>118,432,107 t</nobr> × <nobr>380 ₽</nobr>). If an industrial park is developed based on the deposit (or construction of own production facilities), the value of the reserves will be about <nobr>120 billion ₽</nobr> (<nobr>118,432,107 t</nobr> × <nobr>1,000 ₽</nobr>).

**Our Quarry Valuation**

Considering the market trend of decreasing deposit value relative to its reserve size (the larger the object, the cheaper the base cost per <nobr>1 m³</nobr> of minerals), we consider the fairest valuation of the offered object to be around <nobr>6.5 ₽</nobr> per <nobr>1 m³</nobr>, and the total quarry cost around <nobr>530 million ₽</nobr> (<nobr>81,586,563 m³</nobr> × <nobr>6.5 ₽</nobr>). Note that the cheapest cubic meter of extracted sand (not quartz, but 2nd class) on the RF market is <nobr>8 ₽</nobr> per <nobr>1 m³</nobr> (see table).

However, considering that our deposit is very large (no analogues on the market), and there is interest in a quick sale, we have formed a special price offer calculated based on the state valuation of the object + 5%.

**The final selling price** of the deposit is:

<nobr>359.7 million ₽</nobr> + 5% = <nobr>377.7 million ₽</nobr>.

**Calculation of the average cost per <nobr>1 m³</nobr>**:

<nobr>377,700,000 ₽</nobr> (total cost) ÷ <nobr>81,586,563 m³</nobr> (quantity of reserves) = <nobr>4.63 ₽</nobr>.

**This is the best offer among all categories of sand in the Russian Federation**.
