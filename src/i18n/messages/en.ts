### Mining and processing plant

The functions of the mining and processing plant include extraction, enrichment and sale of quartz sand for various industries. The technology involves crushing, magnetic separation, washing, drying, calcination and other methods of material processing to improve its characteristics. The quality of initial and enriched quartz sands is controlled by the content of iron, silicon, aluminum oxides in them, as well as granulometric composition, content of clay component and moisture. Plants provide the necessary raw materials to metallurgical, machine-building, construction companies.

### Glass production

Quartz sand is the main raw material for the production of various types of glass, including window glass, dishes, porcelain, mirrors and other glass products. Glass contains up to 65–73% of quartz sand of the so-called «glass grade», deposits of which our deposit is rich in.

### Steel industry

Molding type of sand is used. It contains at least 90% silicon dioxide and no more than 2% clay component. This gives the material a high degree of fire resistance and moisture resistance. Our deposit has raw materials of the required quality (and even exceeds in characteristics) for this type of activity.

### Brick production

Quartz sand is used for the production of silicate bricks. It is the main component in the composition of the product, provides good adhesion and shape stability. For the manufacture of silicate bricks, quartz sand with a fraction of <nobr>0.1–5 mm</nobr> is used. Before use, it is pre-washed, dried and cleaned of impurities.

### Microelectronics production

Quartz sand serves as a base material for the production of microelectronics, in particular processors. It contains silicon, which is a semiconductor and allows creating microcircuits of any structure. The production process is divided into several stages: transformation of raw material into the purest and correct structure (1), creation of a silicon single crystal (2), preparation of wafers from a single crystal (3), «printing» of the processor (4). Quartz sand of our deposit almost entirely consists of silicon oxide and is an excellent raw material for the production of microelectronics components.

### Road construction

Sand is used at each stage of road construction – in the preparation of the road base, backfilling of intermediate layers, as well as the construction of the top coating. The sand deposit is located in a promising road construction zone near major transport interchanges (including in close proximity to the federal highway) and megacities (cities of Volgograd and Volzhsky).

### Production of reinforced concrete products

Sand is used in the production of reinforced concrete products (RC products) as a fine aggregate. Its main task is to fill the voids between the grains of crushed stone to ensure the same strength characteristics throughout the volume of the concrete mix.

### Production of paving slabs

Quartz sand is promising to use as a raw material for the manufacture of fired ceramic road-building products, including tiles. In addition, sand is used for grouting tile joints.

### Building materials

Sand is one of the main building materials. It is included in the main dry mixes, masonry and plaster mixes, concretes.

### Landscape design

Sand is a universal material for landscape design. With its help, you can create cozy corners, zone space, add texture. Sand is used for leveling plots, backfilling roads, sidewalks and площадок, arranging beaches, creating sandboxes.

### Abrasive processing

Quartz sand is used in sandblasting units for polishing, removing rust and contaminants from various surfaces.

### Filtration systems

Household filters for water purification in water pipes and swimming pools and even industrial filtration stations use quartz sand.

      title: 'Industrial park',
      text: `
The concept of **industrial park** is based on the idea of creating a complex of enterprises near the deposit for processing extracted minerals. The area of the land plot of <nobr>187 Ha</nobr> is not occupied by mineral deposits, so it can be used for the implementation of this project.

Areas of activity of industrial park enterprises:
- **Mineral enrichment** (preparation of raw materials for the needs of park enterprises and other consumers outside it)
- **Glass industry** (production of sheet and container glass, glass blocks for walls, float glass, etc.)
- **Construction industry** (production of aerated concrete, bricks, dry building mixes, building materials, ceramic products)
- **Electronic industry** (production of components for microelectronics)
- **Metallurgical industry** (production of molding material for steel, cast iron and non-ferrous casting)

Stages of project implementation:
- Construction of a mining and processing plant to provide raw materials to park participants (basic production complex of the project)
- Provision of the park site with the necessary engineering, transport and energy infrastructure
- Attraction of companies from Russia, CIS, China as park participants by selling land plots for the construction of production facilities

      text: `
When determining the cost of a quarry, it is necessary to take into account that this is not quite a typical object. The range of price offers in this niche market can be very significant. Most professional appraisers do not have special knowledge in the field of subsoil use, therefore, in this matter, the assistance of geologists and mining engineers is required.

When holding a competition or auction for the right to use a subsoil plot, the state usually calculates the amount of the starting payment in accordance with the order of the Ministry of Natural Resources of Russia dated September 30, 2008 N 232 «On approval of the Methodology for determining the starting amount of a one-time payment for subsoil use». The amount of the starting payment is not the market value of the deposit, however, this is the first step to understanding the **minimum valuation of the object**.

The starting amount of a one-time payment gives an understanding of how the state assesses subsoil based on the average annual volume of mineral extraction and the average annual amount of mineral extraction tax. Knowing the total volume of balance reserves of a mineral and the average annual volume of extraction, it is possible to calculate the number of years of development of a subsoil plot.

Based on these methods, specialists of a state institution in the field of geology calculated the starting payment for our quarry (in the event that the object participated in an auction for the right to use subsoil for a period of <nobr>49 years</nobr>). Its amount was <nobr>327 million ₽</nobr>. In order for the transaction to take place, it is also necessary to pay the cost of one auction step. According to the Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation dated <nobr>12/28/2021 No. 2499</nobr>, the size of the auction step for the right to use a subsoil plot is 10% of the minimum (starting) size of a one-time payment for subsoil use. Thus, the base cost of renting a quarry for <nobr>49 years</nobr> will be: <nobr>327 million ₽</nobr> (starting auction price) + <nobr>32.7 million ₽</nobr> (minimum size of one auction step) = <nobr>359.7 million ₽</nobr>.

In our case, the quarry is privately owned, which is its undoubted advantage. In addition, the quarry owner has the right to extract minerals for <nobr>177 years</nobr>. Thus, we conclude that the **lower threshold of the cost of our deposit in the amount of <nobr>359.7 million ₽</nobr>** is not entirely fair.

      text: `
Market value is the most probable price at which an object can be sold on the open market in a competitive environment, when the parties to the transaction act reasonably, having all the necessary information, and the transaction price is not affected by any significant circumstances.

The development of our deposit implies the deployment of a diversified business in various market niches. The combination of such characteristics as convenient location (1), exceptional quality of minerals (2), huge volume of reserves (3), availability of a long-term license (4), favorable extraction conditions (5), availability of vast lands for the construction of production complexes near the quarry (6), technical possibility of supplying the enterprise with electricity, gas and water (7) – strongly distinguish the object against the background of most mining enterprises in Russia, narrowly focused primarily on the sale of sand for the construction industry.

When determining the market value, we propose to focus on the price of similar objects, information about the sale of which is published on various Internet resources. But the problem is that it is difficult to find an object with a similar area, volume of reserves, logistics and other factors.

We analyzed ALL sand quarries for sale in Russia, but could not find a comparable analogue to our offer, which would simultaneously have all of the above advantages. Nevertheless, we have identified some trends in the pricing of deposits, which we propose to familiarize ourselves with in the next section.

We present a selection of sand quarries of the Russian Federation that are currently publicly for sale. Special attention was paid to deposits located near large cities, having reserves of high-quality non-waterlogged sand, which can be extracted by open pit mining. Attention was paid to the availability of a license and the legal status of land offered for sale of natural objects. Based on the information received, calculations of the average cost of <nobr>1 m³</nobr> of sand in the subsoil were made.
      `.trim(),
      text2: `
The price range for deposits is very large. The cheapest <nobr>1 m³</nobr> of sand subsoil was found in the Vladimir region – <nobr>8 ₽</nobr> per <nobr>1 m³</nobr> of 2nd class sand. This is almost 2 times more expensive than the basic assessment of quartz sand of our quarry, which is an order of magnitude more valuable. The most expensive <nobr>1 m³</nobr> from our analysis is located in Mordovia and costs a record <nobr>145 ₽</nobr> per sand subsoil of the same 2nd class.

There are very few quarries with quartz sand, the use of which is much wider than the «construction grade», currently on sale. About a dozen quartz quarries sold over the past 3 years have been found, which confirms the demand for this type of natural resources. The largest quartz sand deposit in public sale was found in the Voronezh region - reserves of <nobr>7 million m³</nobr> (<nobr>11 million tons</nobr>), the land plot is leased, there is a license for exploration and extraction of subsoil for <nobr>16 years</nobr>, the cost of the object – <nobr>300 million ₽</nobr> (average price <nobr>1 m³</nobr> – <nobr>42.85</nobr>).

As a result of the analysis, we could not identify subsoil objects for any objective comparison with our offer – neither in terms of volume and quality of reserves, nor in terms of deposit cost, nor in terms of other related conditions.

**Conclusions based on the analysis of the market for the sale of sand deposits**:
- The average cost of sand subsoil in the Russian Federation is <nobr>39.21 ₽</nobr> per <nobr>1 m³</nobr> (based on processing data from all offers for sand quarries for sale)
- The larger the reserves of the quarry, the cheaper the average price of <nobr>1 m³</nobr> (the law of the wholesale market applies)
- The price range for quartz sand in the subsoil varies from <nobr>18.63 ₽</nobr> to <nobr>42.85 ₽</nobr> per <nobr>1 m³</nobr>
- There are no quartz sand quarries on the market that could be compared with our offer (in terms of the amount of reserves and quality of sand, as well as a combination of other criteria)
- The cost of most offers is not sufficiently justified and is spontaneous in nature

**Cost of mineral reserves in the subsoil of our quarry (excluding operating expenses for their extraction and processing)**:
- Extractable reserves of the deposit in tons = <nobr>81,586,563 m³</nobr> (amount of confirmed reserves) − 10% (mineral extraction losses) = <nobr>73,427,906.7 m³</nobr> (amount of extractable reserves) ÷ <nobr>0.62</nobr> = <nobr>118,432,107 t</nobr> (extractable reserves in tons)
- Average cost of basic quality construction sand = <nobr>380 ₽/t</nobr>
- Average cost of quartz («glass») sand = <nobr>2,500 ₽/t</nobr>
- Fair price of quartz sand for participants of the «industrial park» project = <nobr>1,000 ₽/t</nobr>

Thus, the types of activity of a mining enterprise can greatly affect the final cost of sand sales. If the quarry is used for a narrow profile to supply counterparties in the construction industry, reserves are estimated at <nobr>45 billion ₽</nobr> (<nobr>118,432,107 t</nobr> × <nobr>380 ₽</nobr>). If an industrial park (or construction of own production facilities) is developed on the basis of the deposit, the cost of reserves will be <nobr>from 120 billion ₽</nobr> (<nobr>118,432,107 t</nobr> × <nobr>1000 ₽</nobr>) <nobr>to 300 billion ₽</nobr> (<nobr>118,432,107 t</nobr> × <nobr>2,500 ₽</nobr>).

**Our quarry valuation**

Taking into account the trend of market depreciation of the deposit cost relative to the size of its reserves (the larger the object, the cheaper the base cost of <nobr>1 m³</nobr> of minerals), we consider the most fair valuation of the object offered for purchase in the region of <nobr>6.5 ₽</nobr> per <nobr>1 m³</nobr>, and the total cost of the quarry in the region of <nobr>530 million ₽</nobr> (<nobr>81,586,563 m³</nobr> × <nobr>6.5 ₽</nobr>). It should be taken into account that the cheapest cubic meter of fossil sand (not quartz, but 2nd class) in the Russian market is <nobr>8 ₽</nobr> per <nobr>1 m³</nobr> (see table).

However, taking into account the fact that our deposit is very large (there are no analogues in the market), and there is also an interest in the rapid sale of the object, we have formed a special price offer, calculated by the formula: basic state valuation of the object + 5%.

**Total selling price** of the deposit amounted to:  
<nobr>359.7 million ₽</nobr> + 5% = <nobr>377.7 million ₽</nobr>

**Calculation of the average cost of <nobr>1 m³</nobr>**:  
<nobr>377,700,000 ₽</nobr> (total cost) ÷ <nobr>81,586,563 m³</nobr> (amount of reserves) = <nobr>4.63 ₽</nobr>

**The benefit is obvious!**
